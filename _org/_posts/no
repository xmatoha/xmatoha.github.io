* Intro
This post summarizes most common usage of magic mock and specifically
pytest-mock which is thin wrapper around magic mock.

* Patching
First useful feature is patching functions in module. 
#+begin_src python
  import pytest
  from pytest_mocking import MockerFixture

  def test_1(mocker:Mockerfixture):
      mocker.

#+end_src
