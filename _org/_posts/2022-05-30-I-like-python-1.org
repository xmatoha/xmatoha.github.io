* Intro
This post summarizes most common usage of magic mock and specifically
pytest-mock which is thin wrapper around magic mock.

* Patching :test:pytest:mocking:
First useful feature is patching functions in module. 
Lets imagine we have following code in module ui.py
 
#+begin_src python
from some_package import my_print_function
def render_data(data):
    my_print_function(data)
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
  import pytest
  from pytest_mocking import MockerFixture

  def test_1(mocker:Mockerfixture):
      print_mock = mocker.patch('ui.my_print_function')
      print_mock.return_value = ''

#+end_src
